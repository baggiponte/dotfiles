## FAQ

* **In what order are zsh startup files sourced?**
Zsh read these files in the following order:

    `.zshenv` - Should only contain userâ€™s environment variables.
    `.zprofile` - Can be used to execute commands just after logging in.
    `.zshrc` - Should be used for the shell configuration and for executing commands.
    `.zlogin` - Same purpose than `.zprofile`, but read just after `.zshrc`.
    `.zlogout` - Can be used to execute commands when a shell exit.
