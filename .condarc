channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults

# # channel_priority (ChannelPriority)
# #   Accepts values of 'strict', 'flexible', and 'disabled'. The default
# #   value is 'flexible'. With strict channel priority, packages in lower
# #   priority channels are not considered if a package with the same name
# #   appears in a higher priority channel. With flexible channel priority,
# #   the solver may reach into lower priority channels to fulfill
# #   dependencies, rather than raising an unsatisfiable error. With channel
# #   priority disabled, package version takes precedence, and the
# #   configured priority of channels is used only to break ties. In
# #   previous versions of conda, this parameter was configured as either
# #   True or False. True is now an alias to 'flexible'.
# # 
channel_priority: strict

# defaults includes main, r and msys2 (Windows only)
# see: https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/
# # channel_alias (str)
# #   The prepended url location to associate with channel names.
# #
# #   Whenever you use the -c or --channel flag to give conda a channel name that is not a URL,
# #   conda prepends the channel_alias to the name that it was given.
# #   The default channel_alias is https://conda.anaconda.org.
# #
# channel_alias: https://conda.anaconda.org

# # default_channels (sequence: primitive)
# #   env var string delimiter: ','
# #   The list of channel names and/or urls used for the 'defaults'
# #   multichannel.

# # envs_dirs (sequence: primitive)
# #   aliases: envs_path
# #   env var string delimiter: ':'
# #   The list of directories to search for named environments. When
# #   creating a new named environment, the environment will be placed in
# #   the first writable location.
# #
# # The CONDA_ENVS_PATH environment variable overwrites the envs_dirs setting:
# # For macOS and Linux: CONDA_ENVS_PATH=~/my-envs:/opt/anaconda/envs
# # For Windows: set CONDA_ENVS_PATH=C:\Users\joe\envs;C:\Anaconda\envs

# envs_dirs: []

# # pkgs_dirs (sequence: primitive)
# #   env var string delimiter: ','
# #   The list of directories where locally-available packages are linked
# #   from at install time. Packages not locally available are downloaded
# #   and extracted into the first writable directory.
# #
# pkgs_dirs: []

# # auto_activate_base (bool)
# #   Automatically activate the base environment during shell
# #   initialization.

#   When using activate, change the command prompt ($PS1) to include the
